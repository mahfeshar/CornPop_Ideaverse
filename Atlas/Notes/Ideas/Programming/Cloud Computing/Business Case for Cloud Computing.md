- The adoption of cloud technologies enables enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive and to create differentiated customer experiences. Organizations are asking not whether they should move to the cloud but rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.
    
- Some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting the cloud:
    
    - American Airlines adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value rapidly across its enterprise
        
    - UBank leveraging cloud platform services to give more control to their developers, thereby removing barriers to innovation
        
    - Bitly leveraging the scalability offered by cloud infrastructure for low-latency delivery to its geographically dispersed enterprise customers
        
    - ActivTrades leveraging the infrastructure, storage, network, and security offerings on the cloud to accelerate execution and delivery of new functions in their online trading systems to their customers
- Businesses that do not integrate cloud into their business strategy, run the risk of lacking the speed, agility, innovation, and decision-making capacities needed to be competitive, as also their ability to respond to digital disruption.
