## History
- In the early 1970s, _IBM_ developed __SQL__(Structured Query Language) for use in its original relational database product named System R.
- Other vendors started building their own database systems and developed query languages based on the standard SQL.
- __SQL__ became a _standard_ of the (ABSI), and of the (ISO)
- __T-SQL__ is an extension to SQL used by Microsoft SQL Server.
## What is SQL?
- We talked before about [[Database]]
- SQL is a programming language used by nearly all [[Conceptual Data Models#3. Relational Model (**الأشهر**)|Relational Database]] to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. 

SQL is composed of three parts:
1. Data definition language (DDL) includes statements for defining the database and its objects such as tables, [views](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-views/), [triggers](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-triggers/), [stored procedures](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-stored-procedure/), etc.
2. Data manipulation language (DML) contains statements for [updating](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-basics/mysql-update/) and [querying data](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-basics/mysql-select-from/)
3. Data control language (DCL) allows you to [grant permissions](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-administration/mysql-grant/) to users to access specific data in the database.
