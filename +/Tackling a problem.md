Before tackling a problem you should be
	Ready / Relax
	Active as if you are in a conest
	Challenge Spirit
	Don't rush / Don't panic
	Check your watch - Monitor your progress


We could think in Solving a problem as stages
	1- Reading and correctly "understanding" problem statement
	2- "Thinking" in a solution -> Verifying it
	3- Coding
	4- Debugging if necessary
	5- Testing

Hence your overall performance depends on performance in every stage.
	The more better in one of stages, the better overall performance.
	Then, your practice plans must care with all the stages.
	Always measure time you do for every phase, this will help you know your problems
	The training must be varied and you should focus on your weaknesses.
	Another dimension for performance is your speed.
